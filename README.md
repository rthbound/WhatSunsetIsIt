# What Sunset Is It?
[WhatColorIsIt](https://github.com/MarvinMenzerath/WhatColorIsIt)[.](http://marvinmenzerath.github.io/WhatColorIsIt/) inspired me to use my knowledge of USNO's data services to put this together. The page's background image is continually updated with a view of our Sunset as seen from some point in space.
